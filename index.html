			  <h3>My journey to here....</h3>
			    <p>Having spent many years working in an outdoor environment, for 35 years as a golf professional and golf course manager, and the last 8 years as an estates worker for a wildlife trust, I have enjoyed my time in roles of a physical nature. I have been fortunate to acquire, along the way, a wide reaching and varied skill set in both management and practical situations.

  			  <h3>My passions....</h3>
  			    <p>As a keen bird watcher from the age of about 8 years old I developed a life-long love of nature and wildlife. A planned trip to South Africa in 2005 rompted me to take up photography, a hobby which has grown to a passion over the years.                    </p>

			<div class="future">
  			  <h3>And now!..</h3>
  			    <p>My new journey begins...! Although, I am pleased to say, I am still physically capable of working in a physical role, I must now admit to myself that, in time, I will need to be prepared for opportunities which place less strain on the body and will allow me to develop a career that will see me through to retirement and hopefully beyond. However I would truly love this to be within an environment which is stimulating, cteative and allows for continual progress in order to keep the career path fresh and exciting. Software developement seems to tick all those boxes and I am pleased to be embarking on this new learning adventure.
