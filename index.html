		  <h3>Hi.&ensp;I'm Tim.&ensp;I am just about to graduate from the iO Academy Full Stack Track bootcamp and am now
			  looking for my first role in software development. <br><br> Let me introduce myself.</h3>

			 <h1>About me</h2>
			
			<div class="journey">
			  <h3>My journey to here....</h3>
			    <p>Previous careers as a golf professional, golf course manager, and more recently as Senior
					Estates Worker for a wildlife trust, have allowed me to enjoy my time in roles of both a physical and
					corporate nature. I have been fortunate to acquire, along the way, a wide-ranging and varied skill
					set in both management and practical situations.<br> With experience working alone and as part of
					a team, my past roles have generally culminated in a senior position involving mentoring and
					developing newer team members and trainees, which I have always found rewarding and fulfilling.

				</p>	
		    </div>

			<div class="future">
				<h3>And now!..</h3>
				<p>My new journey begins...!
					I would truly love the next stage of my career to be within an environment which is stimulating,
					creative and allows for continual progress in order to keep the career path fresh and exciting.
					<br>Software development seems to tick all those boxes and I am pleased to be embarking
					on this new dynamic adventure. <br> The iO Academy bootcamp has been a great vehicle with which to
					start this process and has reaffirmed the many and varied opportunities that this career can
					offer. The content of the course has been comprehensive and the challenges have fitted well with my
					thirst for knowledge and my lifelong interest for problem and puzzle solving. I am excited at the
					prospect of taking the next steps to increase my skills and apply them to real world projects.
				</p>
			</div>
			
			<div class="personal">
				<h3>My interests....</h3>
				<p>  As mentioned above, I enjoy keeping an active mind with quizzes, cryptic and other crosswords,
					anagrams and general word games. I have also enjoyed creating a number of themed anagram challenges
					which I have used to raise money for local charities. <br>In addition, as a keen bird watcher from
					the age of about 8 years old I have developed a life-long love of nature and wildlife. A planned
					trip to South Africa in 2005 prompted me to take up photography, a hobby which has grown to a
					passion over the years, during which I have acquired an L.R.P.S distinction with the Royal
					Photographic Society and had some success in competitions in the advanced section of a local
					camera club. <br>Venturing into the realms of macro photography in recent years has opened my eyes
					to a whole new world of miniature wonder and stimulated a deep interest in invertebrates and other
					tiny life forms which go largely unnoticed. Following this mini safari, with all the symbiosis
					and daily 'life and death' struggles encapsulates my thirst for knowledge.
