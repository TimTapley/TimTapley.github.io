			<div class="journey">
			  <h3>My journey to here....</h3>
			    <p>Having spent many years working largely in an outdoor environment, for 35 years as a golf professional and golf course manager, and the last 8 years as Senior Estates Worker for a wildlife trust, I have enjoyed my time in roles of a physical nature. I have been fortunate to acquire, along the way, a wide reaching and varied skill set in both management and practical situations.

  			  <h3>My passions....</h3>
  			    <p>As a keen bird watcher from the age of about 8 years old I have developed a life-long love of nature and wildlife. A planned trip to South Africa in 2005 prompted me to take up photography, a hobby which has grown to a passion over the years, during which I have acquired an L.R.P.S distinction with the Royal Photographic Society and had some success in competitions in the advanced section of a local camera club. <br><br>Venturing into the realms of macro photography in recent years has opened my eyes to a whole new world of miniature wonder and stimulated a deep interest in invertebrates and other tiny life forms which go largely unnoticed. Following this mini safari, with all the symbiosis and daily 'life and death' struggles encapsulates my thirst for knowledge.            
				</p>

			<div class="future">
  			  <h3>And now!..</h3>
  			    <p>My new journey begins...! Although, I am pleased to say, I am still physically capable of working in an active role, I must now admit to myself that, in time, I will need to be prepared for opportunities which place less strain on the body and will allow me to develop a career that will see me through to retirement and hopefully beyond. However I would truly love this to be within an environment which is stimulating, creative and allows for continual progress in order to keep the career path fresh and exciting. Software development seems to tick all those boxes and I am pleased to be embarking on this new dynamic adventure.
