			 <h1>About me</h2>
			
			<div class="journey">
			  <h3>My journey to here....</h3>
			    <p>Having spent many years working largely in an outdoor environment, for 35 years as a golf
					professional and golf course manager, and the last 8 years as Senior Estates Worker for a
					wildlife trust, I have enjoyed my time in roles of both a physical and corporate nature.
					I have been fortunate to acquire, along the way, a wide-ranging and varied skill set in
					both management and practical situations.<br> With experience working alone or as part of a team, my
					past roles have generally culminated in a senior position involving mentoring and developing newer
					team members and trainees, which I have always found rewarding and fulfilling.

				</p>

			<div class="personal">
  			  <h3>My interests....</h3>
  			    <p>As a keen bird watcher from the age of about 8 years old I have developed a life-long love of
					nature and wildlife. A planned trip to South Africa in 2005 prompted me to take up photography,
					a hobby which has grown to a passion over the years, during which I have acquired an
					L.R.P.S distinction with the Royal Photographic Society and had some success in competitions
					in the advanced section of a local camera club. <br>Venturing into the realms of macro
					photography in recent years has opened my eyes to a whole new world of miniature wonder and
					stimulated a deep interest in invertebrates and other tiny life forms which go largely unnoticed.
					Following this mini safari, with all the symbiosis and daily 'life and death' struggles
					encapsulates my thirst for knowledge. <br> I also enjoy keeping an active mind with
					quizzes, cryptic and other crosswords, anagrams and general word games. I have created a number of anagram
					challenges which I have used to raise money for local charities.
				</p>
			</div>
			
			<div class="future">
  			  <h3>And now!..</h3>
  			    <p>My new journey begins...! Although, I am pleased to say, I am still physically capable of working
					in an active role, I must now prepare for opportunities which place less strain on the body and
					will allow me to develop a career that will see me through to retirement and hopefully beyond.
					However, I would truly love this to be within an environment which is stimulating, creative and
					allows for continual progress in order to keep the career path fresh and exciting. <br>
					Software development seems to tick all those boxes and I am pleased to be embarking
					on this new dynamic adventure. <br> The iO bootcamp has been a great vehicle with which to
					start this process and has reaffirmed the many and varied opportunities that this career can
					offer. I am excited at the prospect of taking the next steps to increase my skills and apply
					them to real world projects.
